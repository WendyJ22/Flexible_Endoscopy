# Flexible_Endoscopy

The Matlab code is focus on 3D image reconstruction of the image gained by the flexible endoscopy.  The projector is treated as an "inverse camera", project structured light, obtain the depth information of the object, and then carry out three-dimensional reconstruction. The code is tested on 

## Solidworks

The new design of the flexible endoscopy is by focusing on improving the probe of the endoscope, so that the endoscope can construct three-dimensional images through structured light projector.

## Matlab
The Matlab code is focus on 3D image reconstruction of the image gained by the flexible endoscopy.  The projector is treated as an "inverse camera", project structured light, obtain the depth information of the object, and then carry out three-dimensional reconstruction.  

- Run `up_test_obj.mat` to obtain phase information of the test image and can be used to simulate structured light projection.
