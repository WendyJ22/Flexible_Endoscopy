# Flexible_Endoscopy

Flexible endoscopes are an ideal instrument for observing the inner tissue of patients. In this project, SolidWorks is utilzed to recreate the optics structure of the common flexible endoscope. Additionally, the MATLAB program enables the 3D reconstruction of images captured using flexible endoscopes. This new design and development enhance the endoscope's capability to construct a three-dimensional image of the inner tissue.

## Solidworks

New designs for flexible endoscopes focus on improving the endoscope's probe, allowing the endoscope to construct a three-dimensional image through a structured light projector.

## Matlab
The Matlab code focuses on 3D image reconstruction of images obtained with flexible endoscopes. The projector is regarded as an "inverse camera" that projects structured light, obtains the depth information of the object, and then performs three-dimensional reconstruction.

- Run `up_test_obj.mat` to obtain phase information of the test image and can be used to simulate structured light projection.
