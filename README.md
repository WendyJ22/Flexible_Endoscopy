# Flexible_Endoscopy

The Matlab code is focus on 3D image reconstruction of the image gained by the flexible endoscopy.  The projector is treated as an "inverse camera", project structured light, obtain the depth information of the object, and then carry out three-dimensional reconstruction. The code is tested on 

## Solidworks

New designs for flexible endoscopes focus on improving the endoscope's probe, allowing the endoscope to construct a three-dimensional image through a structured light projector.

## Matlab
The Matlab code focuses on 3D image reconstruction of images obtained with flexible endoscopes. The projector is regarded as an "inverse camera" that projects structured light, obtains the depth information of the object, and then performs three-dimensional reconstruction.

- Run `up_test_obj.mat` to obtain phase information of the test image and can be used to simulate structured light projection.
